# trainSchedule

This was a fun project to show off our database skills. Using the database i was able to add new trains and show existing trains on the schedule. The users will always have up to date synced data regardless of what computer they are viewing the website from. Overall this was a fun project and i was able to use it to learn alot! Have fun and add some new trains!
